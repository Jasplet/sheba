1.2 References

The code SHEBA was written by James Wookey (University of Bristol) based in part
on subroutines written by Nick Teanby. The algorithm used by SHEBA for multi-
window analysis is described in:

Teanby, N; Kendall, J-M. and Van Der Baan, M. (2004), "Automation of shear-wave
   splitting measurements using cluster analysis", BSSA, vol 94, pp 453-463

Various other academic papers are referenced in individual subroutines.

Section 2: Prerequisites

2.1 Operating system

     SHEBA has been compiled on run successfully on several platforms including
      Linux, MacOSX and Solaris. Other UNIX variants are likely to work, but 
      no guarantees! 

      The multiple window analysis can be quite computationally expensive, so
      older machines (for example older sparc machines) may struggle. If this
      is the case, use the 'nwind one' option. 	

2.2 SHEBA requires utilities from several packages to compile and run fully: 

	- SAC, SAC2000 or MacSAC (the sac.a library is NOT required however)

	- GMT (several GMT programs are used for plotting) 

	- A postscript viewer. GV is recommended (and assumed by the SAC macro).  

	- PSUTILS and GHOSTSCRIPT are required for the "plot yes" option, though
        this could potentially be circumvented. 

	- A Fortran 90 compiler. The gnu compiler GFORTRAN is compatible. Other
        compilers known to have worked are ifort, xlf, g95 and Solaris f90. G77
        and other Fortran 77 compilers will NOT work. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 3: Compiling

	- Edit the Makefile to set up:
	    * Compiler and options. Since the code can be quite intensive, 
	      optimisation is recommended. Some suggested configurations are
	      given in the Makefile.
	    * The two path variables (MACRODIR and EXECDIR) to wherever you want 
	      the macros, scripts and binaries to wind up. Remember that these
	      must be on the SAC macro path and in your $PATH respectively so
	      that they can be found.
	    * SAC compatibility option. (e.g., MacSAC vs. sac2000)  

	- Type 'make'. This will compile all the codes, and install binaries, 
        shell scripts and SAC macros. 'make clean' will remove all object
        files to allow a clean install.   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Section 4: Running the code

	- SHEBA is most easily run from the SAC macro sheba. 
        - Type, e.g.: m sheba file MYFILE comps E N Z pick yes 
          (note that an identical macro called split_sheba is provided
           for legacy reasons)
	- For (many) other options see the sheba macro
